# Hugo Blog site
This is my Hugo static-site generated blog, using pure.css for layouts and custom styling. Deployed to gh-pages.

I'll eventually turn this into a theme I can give back to the community but for now it's going to be myblog and I'll generate the static content that github pages will serve using Hugo, the static site generator written in Go.
